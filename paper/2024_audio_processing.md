| Normalization         | Adjusts the amplitude of the audio signal to a standard range.             |
| Noise Reduction       | Removes unwanted background noise from the audio signal.                   |
| Feature Extraction     | Extracts relevant features from the audio signal, such as MFCCs.          |
| Resampling            | Changes the sample rate of the audio signal to a different frequency.      |
| Trimming/Silence Removal | Cuts out silent parts of the audio signal to reduce file size and improve processing. |
