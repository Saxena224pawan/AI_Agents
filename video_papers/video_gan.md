# VideoGAN

## Overview
VideoGAN is a generative adversarial network designed for video generation. It leverages the power of GANs to create realistic video sequences from random noise.

## Key Contributions
- Introduced a novel architecture that combines spatial and temporal information for video generation.
- Demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality video frames that are coherent over time.

## Applications
- Video synthesis for entertainment and media.
- Data augmentation for training machine learning models.

## Limitations
- Requires a large amount of training data to produce high-quality results.
- May struggle with generating long video sequences without artifacts.

## Future Work
- Explore improvements in training stability and quality.
- Investigate the use of additional modalities (e.g., audio) for more comprehensive video generation.
