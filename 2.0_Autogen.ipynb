      "        World model-based searching and planning are widely recognized as a promising path toward human-level physical intelligence. However, current driving world models primarily rely on video diffusion models, which specialize in visual generation but lack the flexibility to incorporate other modalities like action. In contrast, autoregressive transformers have demonstrated exceptional capability in modeling multimodal data. Our work aims to unify both driving model simulation and trajectory planning into a single sequence modeling problem. We introduce a multimodal driving language based on interleaved image and action tokens, and develop DrivingGPT to learn joint world modeling and planning through standard next-token prediction. Our DrivingGPT demonstrates strong performance in both action-conditioned video generation and end-to-end planning, outperforming strong baselines on large-scale nuPlan and NAVSIM benchmarks.\n",

      "        Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.\n",

      "        Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.\n",

      "        Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious medical condition that presents significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in settings with limited access to healthcare resources. Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for visualizing the GI tract, but it requires time-consuming manual analysis by experienced gastroenterologists, which is prone to human error and inefficient given the increasing number of patients.To address this challenge, we propose ClassifyViStA, an AI-based framework designed for the automated detection and classification of bleeding and non-bleeding frames from WCE videos. The model consists of a standard classification path, augmented by two specialized branches: an implicit attention branch and a segmentation branch.The attention branch focuses on the bleeding regions, while the segmentation branch generates accurate segmentation masks, which are used for classification and interpretability. The model is built upon an ensemble of ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures to enhance classification performance. For the bleeding region detection, we implement a Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft NMS) approach with YOLOv8, which improves the handling of overlapping bounding boxes, resulting in more accurate and nuanced detections.The system's interpretability is enhanced by using the segmentation masks to explain the classification results, offering insights into the decision-making process similar to the way a gastroenterologist identifies bleeding regions. Our approach not only automates the detection of GI bleeding but also provides an interpretable solution that can ease the burden on healthcare professionals and improve diagnostic efficiency.

Our method includes a pose-aware encoder and a diffusion-based denoiser to refine low-quality multi-view images, along with data augmentation and a multi-view attention module with epipolar aggregation to maintain consistent, high-quality 3D outputs across views. Unlike existing video-based approaches, our model supports seamless multi-view enhancement with improved coherence across diverse viewing angles.

      "        Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.\n",

      "        AI-generated content (AIGC), such as advertisement copy, product descriptions, and social media posts, is becoming ubiquitous in business practices. However, the value of AI-generated metadata, such as titles, remains unclear on user-generated content (UGC) platforms. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale field experiment on a leading short-video platform in Asia to provide about 1 million users access to AI-generated titles for their uploaded videos. Our findings show that the provision of AI-generated titles significantly boosted content consumption, increasing valid watches by 1.6% and watch duration by 0.9%. When producers adopted these titles, these increases jumped to 7.1% and 4.1%, respectively. This viewership-boost effect was largely attributed to the use of this generative AI (GAI) tool increasing the likelihood of videos having a title by 41.4%. The effect was more pronounced for groups more affected by metadata sparsity. Mechanism analysis revealed that AI-generated metadata improved user-video matching accuracy in the platform's recommender system. Interestingly, for a video for which the producer would have posted a title anyway, adopting the AI-generated title decreased its viewership on average, implying that AI-generated titles may be of lower quality than human-generated ones. However, when producers chose to co-create with GAI and significantly revised the AI-generated titles, the videos outperformed their counterparts with either fully AI-generated or human-generated titles, showcasing the benefits of human-AI co-creation. This study highlights the value of AI-generated metadata and human-AI metadata co-creation in enhancing user-content matching and content consumption for UGC platforms.\n",

      "        The video-to-audio (V2A) generation task has drawn attention in the field of multimedia due to the practicality in producing Foley sound. Semantic and temporal conditions are fed to the generation model to indicate sound events and temporal occurrence. Recent studies on synthesizing immersive and synchronized audio are faced with challenges on videos with moving visual presence. The temporal condition is not accurate enough while low-resolution semantic condition exacerbates the problem. To tackle these challenges, we propose Smooth-Foley, a V2A generative model taking semantic guidance from the textual label across the generation to enhance both semantic and temporal alignment in audio. Two adapters are trained to leverage pre-trained text-to-audio generation models. A frame adapter integrates high-resolution frame-wise video features while a temporal adapter integrates temporal conditions obtained from similarities of visual frames and textual labels. The incorporation of semantic guidance from textual labels achieves precise audio-video alignment. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. Results show that Smooth-Foley performs better than existing models on both continuous sound scenarios and general scenarios. With semantic guidance, the audio generated by Smooth-Foley exhibits higher quality and better adherence to physical laws.\n",

However, current driving world models primarily rely on video diffusion models, which specialize in visual generation but lack the flexibility to incorporate other modalities like action. In contrast, autoregressive transformers have demonstrated exceptional capability in modeling multimodal data. Our work aims to unify both driving model simulation and trajectory planning into a single sequence modeling problem. We introduce a multimodal driving language based on interleaved image and action tokens, and develop DrivingGPT to learn joint world modeling and planning through standard next-token prediction. Our DrivingGPT demonstrates strong performance in both action-conditioned video generation and end-to-end planning, outperforming strong baselines on large-scale nuPlan and NAVSIM benchmarks.\\n        △ Less\\n\\nTitle: ZeroHSI: Zero-Shot 4D Human-Scene Interaction by Video Generation\\nAuthors: Authors:\\nHongjie Li, \\n      \\n      Hong-Xing Yu, \\n      \\n      Jiaman Li, \\n      \\n      Jiajun Wu\\nAbstract: Abstract:\\n      \\n        Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics.

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.\\n        △ Less\\n\\nTitle: DiTCtrl: Exploring Attention Control in Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Tuning-Free Multi-Prompt Longer Video Generation\\nAuthors: Authors:\\nMinghong Cai, \\n      \\n      Xiaodong Cun, \\n      \\n      Xiaoyu Li, \\n      \\n      Wenze Liu, \\n      \\n      Zhaoyang Zhang, \\n      \\n      Yong Zhang, \\n      \\n      Ying Shan, \\n      \\n      Xiangyu Yue\\nAbstract: Abstract:\\n      \\n        Sora-like video…\\n        ▽ More\\n\\n\\n        Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.\\n        △ Less\\n\\nTitle: ClassifyViStA:WCE Classification with Visual understanding through Segmentation and Attention\\nAuthors: Authors:\\nS.

Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for visualizing the GI tract, but it requires time-consuming manual analysis by experienced gastroenterologists, which is prone to human error and inefficient given the increasing number of patients.To address this challenge, we propose ClassifyViStA, an AI-based framework designed for the automated detection and classification of bleeding and non-bleeding frames from WCE videos. The model consists of a standard classification path, augmented by two specialized branches: an implicit attention branch and a segmentation branch.The attention branch focuses on the bleeding regions, while the segmentation branch generates accurate segmentation masks, which are used for classification and interpretability. The model is built upon an ensemble of ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures to enhance classification performance. For the bleeding region detection, we implement a Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft NMS) approach with YOLOv8, which improves the handling of overlapping bounding boxes, resulting in more accurate and nuanced detections.The system's interpretability is enhanced by using the segmentation masks to explain the classification results, offering insights into the decision-making process similar to the way a gastroenterologist identifies bleeding regions. Our approach not only automates the detection of GI bleeding but also provides an interpretable solution that can ease the burden on healthcare professionals and improve diagnostic efficiency.

In this study, we present a novel 3D enhancement pipeline, dubbed 3DEnhancer, which employs a multi-view latent diffusion model to enhance coarse 3D inputs while preserving multi-view consistency. Our method includes a pose-aware encoder and a diffusion-based denoiser to refine low-quality multi-view images, along with data augmentation and a multi-view attention module with epipolar aggregation to maintain consistent, high-quality 3D outputs across views. Unlike existing video-based approaches, our model supports seamless multi-view enhancement with improved coherence across diverse viewing angles. Extensive evaluations show that 3DEnhancer significantly outperforms existing methods, boosting both multi-view enhancement and per-instance 3D optimization tasks.\\n        △ Less\\n\\nTitle: Explainable Multi-Modal Data Exploration in Natural Language via LLM Agent\\nAuthors: Authors:\\nFarhad Nooralahzadeh, \\n      \\n      Yi Zhang, \\n      \\n      Jonathan Furst, \\n      \\n      Kurt Stockinger\\nAbstract: Abstract:\\n      \\n        International enterprises, organizations, or hospitals collect large amounts of multi-modal data stored in databases, text documents, images, and videos.

While there has been recent progress in the separate fields of multi-modal data exploration as well as in database systems that automatically translate natural language questions to database query languages, the research challenge of querying database systems combined with other unstructured modalities such as images in natural language is widely unexplored.\\n  In this paper, we propose XMODE - a system that enables explainable, multi-modal data exploration in natural language. Our approach is based on the following research contributions: (1) Our system is inspired by a real-world use case that enables users to explore multi-modal information systems. (2) XMODE leverages a LLM-based agentic AI framework to decompose a natural language question into subtasks such as text-to-SQL generation and image analysis. (3) Experimental results on multi-modal datasets over relational data and images demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal exploration systems, excelling not only in accuracy but also in various performance metrics such as query latency, API costs, planning efficiency, and explanation quality, thanks to the more effective utilization of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\\n        △ Less\\n\\nTitle: RDPM: Solve Diffusion Probabilistic Models via Recurrent Token Prediction\\nAuthors: Authors:\\nWu Xiaoping, \\n      \\n      Hu Jie, \\n      \\n      Wei Xiaoming\\nAbstract: Abstract:\\n      \\n        …have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs).

In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.\\n        △ Less\\n\\nTitle: The Value of AI-Generated Metadata for UGC Platforms: Evidence from a Large-scale Field Experiment\\nAuthors: Authors:\\nXinyi Zhang, \\n      \\n      Chenshuo Sun, \\n      \\n      Renyu Zhang, \\n      \\n      Khim-Yong Goh\\nAbstract: Abstract:\\n      \\n        AI-generated content (AIGC), such as advertisement copy, product descriptions, and social media posts, is becoming ubiquitous in business practices.

However, the value of AI-generated metadata, such as titles, remains unclear on user-generated content (UGC) platforms. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale field experiment on a leading short-video platform in Asia to provide about 1 million users access to AI-generated titles for their uploaded videos. Our findings show that the provision of AI-generated titles significantly boosted content consumption, increasing valid watches by 1.6% and watch duration by 0.9%. When producers adopted these titles, these increases jumped to 7.1% and 4.1%, respectively. This viewership-boost effect was largely attributed to the use of this generative AI (GAI) tool increasing the likelihood of videos having a title by 41.4%. The effect was more pronounced for groups more affected by metadata sparsity. Mechanism analysis revealed that AI-generated metadata improved user-video matching accuracy in the platform's recommender system. Interestingly, for a video for which the producer would have posted a title anyway, adopting the AI-generated title decreased its viewership on average, implying that AI-generated titles may be of lower quality than human-generated ones. However, when producers chose to co-create with GAI and significantly revised the AI-generated titles, the videos outperformed their counterparts with either fully AI-generated or human-generated titles, showcasing the benefits of human-AI co-creation. This study highlights the value of AI-generated metadata and human-AI metadata co-creation in enhancing user-content matching and content consumption for UGC platforms.\\n        △ Less\\n\\nTitle: Quo Vadis, Anomaly Detection?

This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.\\n        △ Less\\n\\nTitle: Smooth-Foley: Creating Continuous Sound for Video-to-Audio Generation Under Semantic Guidance\\nAuthors: Authors:\\nYaoyun Zhang, \\n      \\n      Xuenan Xu, \\n      \\n      Mengyue Wu\\nAbstract: Abstract:\\n      \\n        The video-to-audio (V2A)…\\n        ▽ More\\n\\n\\n        The video-to-audio (V2A) generation task has drawn attention in the field of multimedia due to the practicality in producing Foley sound. Semantic and temporal conditions are fed to the generation model to indicate sound events and temporal occurrence. Recent studies on synthesizing immersive and synchronized audio are faced with challenges on videos with moving visual presence. The temporal condition is not accurate enough while low-resolution semantic condition exacerbates the problem. To tackle these challenges, we propose Smooth-Foley, a V2A generative model taking semantic guidance from the textual label across the generation to enhance both semantic and temporal alignment in audio. Two adapters are trained to leverage pre-trained text-to-audio generation models. A frame adapter integrates high-resolution frame-wise video features while a temporal adapter integrates temporal conditions obtained from similarities of visual frames and textual labels. The incorporation of semantic guidance from textual labels achieves precise audio-video alignment. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. Results show that Smooth-Foley performs better than existing models on both continuous sound scenarios and general scenarios. With semantic guidance, the audio generated by Smooth-Foley exhibits higher quality and better adherence to physical laws.\\n        △ Less\\n\\n\", 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'I now have a list of 10 relevant papers on video generation.
