      "     - An extensive description of the architecture.\n",
      "     - Key contributions and innovations.\n",
      "     - A section for Python implementation, including code snippets in a file named `architecture.py`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Review and Feedback (Admin and Critic)**\n",
      "   - The admin and critic will review the markdown files and the summary table. They will provide feedback on the clarity, completeness, and accuracy of the information presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Revise Based on Feedback (Engineer and Scientist)**\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Research and Selection of Architectures:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that the literature review includes recent papers from reputable conferences and journals (e.g., CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, etc.) to guarantee the selection of truly state-of-the-art architectures.\n",
      "   - Consider including a brief justification for each selected architecture in the summary table to provide context for their significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create Summary Markdown Table:**\n",
      "   - In the summary table (`video_paper.md`), consider adding a column for the publication year of each architecture. This will help readers understand the timeline of advancements in video generation.\n",
      "   - Include a column for source URLs to the original papers or repositories for each architecture. This will enhance the verifiability of the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Create Detailed Markdown Files for Each Architecture:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that the extensive descriptions in the individual markdown files (`architecture_name.md`) cover the theoretical foundations, architecture diagrams (if applicable), and any unique training methodologies.\n",
      "   - In the Python implementation section, provide clear instructions on how to set up the environment and any dependencies required to run the code snippets.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Review and Feedback:**\n",
      "   - Specify the criteria for the review process to ensure that the feedback is focused on clarity, completeness, accuracy, and the inclusion of verifiable information.\n",
      "   - Consider involving additional reviewers with expertise in video generation to provide a broader perspective during the review phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Revise Based on Feedback:**\n",
      "   - Allocate sufficient time for revisions based on feedback, especially if significant changes are suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Final Approval:**\n",
      "   - Define the criteria for final approval to ensure that all aspects of the documentation meet the expected standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Considerations:\n",
      "- **Version Control:** Consider using version control (e.g., Git) to manage changes to the markdown files and code snippets. This will facilitate collaboration and track revisions.\n",
      "- **Testing Code Snippets:** While execution of code is not required, it may be beneficial to include comments in the code snippets indicating how they can be tested or what outputs to expect.\n",
      "- **Future Updates:** Plan for potential updates to the documentation as new architectures emerge in the field of video generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
